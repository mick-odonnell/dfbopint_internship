# Background

This notebook outlines the quality assurance of the DFB PIP table.

The chunk below loads some libraries that we will need. 

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
```
We're going to load the cards and the contacts.

```{r load-data}
pip_cards_raw <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/card_data.xlsx")
pip_contacts <- read_csv("data/pip_contacts.csv")
```

Now we will do some manipulation.

```{r data-cleaning}
pip_cards_raw %>%
  separate(Category, into = c("c1", "c2")) %>% 
  select(c1, c2)
```
